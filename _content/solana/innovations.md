-   Tower BFT - a PoH-optimized version of PBFT;

-   Turbine - a block propagation protocol;

-   Gulf Stream - Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol;

-   Sealevel - Parallel smart contracts run-time;

-   Pipelining - a Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization

-   Cloudbreak - Horizontally-Scaled Accounts Database; and
