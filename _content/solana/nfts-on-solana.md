**Yes, it most certainly does.**

As we have covered earlier, Solana NFTs played a huge part in the DeFi Summer of 2021 that went by as the space exploded with projects like the Degen Ape Academy and Aurory going to the moon.

Solana offers a lot to the degen NFT Collector due to its high-speed transactions and NO GAS FEES. Hence, a lot of different projects have come up recently and you can check them out on marketplaces like [Solsea](https://solsea.io/) and [Solanart](https://solanart.io/).

Disclaimer: The Solana NFT ecosystem is VERY new so you will see the words "Beta" and "Alpha" everywhere.
