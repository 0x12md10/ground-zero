Proof of History is probably Solana's core innovation and the reason why it has gotten so popular.

#### So what is it about?

Utilizing Proof of History creates a historical record that proves that an event has occurred at a specific moment in time. This takes away the need to have consensus amongst validators for transactions like other blockchains do because each Solana validator maintains its own clock by encoding the passage of time in a simple SHA-256, sequential-hashing verifiable delay function (VDF).

This presents a fundamental move forward in the structure of blockchain networks in regards to speed and capacity.

Here's an excerpt from the article provided below:

> "The Solana data structure chains messages together. This provides cryptographic proof of the relative order and time of each message in the historical record. This allows the network to ignore local clocks and gradually accommodate all potential network delays as the data structure is eventually delivered and re-assembled. This is why Solana is able to push the limits of confirmation times so that the network provides as effective of an experience as a centralized system without sacrificing security or decentralization."
