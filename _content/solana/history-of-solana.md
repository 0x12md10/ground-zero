[Anatoly Yakovenko](https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko) established the Solana (SOL) platform in 2017. Before starting Solana, Yakovenko worked at Qualcomm. In November of 2017, he published a whitepaper describing Proof of History, a technique for keeping time between computers that do not trust one another.

Here's an excerpt from Solana History docs:

> "Anatoly watched as blockchain systems without clocks, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, struggled to scale beyond 15 transactions per second worldwide when centralized payment systems such as Visa required peaks of 65,000 tps. Without a clock, it was clear they'd never graduate to being the global payment system or global supercomputer most had dreamed them to be. When Anatoly solved the problem of getting computers that don‚Äôt trust each other to agree on time, he knew he had the key to bring 40 years of distributed systems research to the world of blockchain. The resulting cluster wouldn't be just 10 times faster, or a 100 times, or a 1,000 times, but 10,000 times faster, right out of the gate!"

The team is presently supported by prominent businesses throughout the world, including Apple, Qualcomm, Intel, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Dropbox, and others. Many investors, including Multicoin Capital, Foundation Capital, SLOW Capital, CMCC Global, Abstract Ventures, and others, have taken notice of Solana‚Äôs effect.
