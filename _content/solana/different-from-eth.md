Now that you know what Solana is, this is the obvious question that comes to mind next.

Solana is considered as a considerable rival of Ethereum and even an "Ethereum killer" by some, due to the various advantages it has as a blockchain over it. These include:
* Higher transactions speed
* Incredibly cheap gas feesInstantaneous transactions
* Higher Programmability
* Proof of History and Proof of Stake mechanism over Eth's Proof of Work

Solana's high-speed transactions are its greatest feature as it can handle more than 50,000 TPS compared to Ethereum's 15-45 TPS. The contest is far from close.

The lower gas fees are a result of its PoH and PoS mechanisms which currently is a huge advantage to have before Ethereum shifts to PoS as well.

Although Ethereum's going nowhere, Solana's rise does make it interesting to consider what the future of crypto and blockchain technology could look like.
