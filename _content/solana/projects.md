A multitude of projects has been built in the ecosystem to solve for different use-cases. Here's an overview of a few from the [article](https://superteam.substack.com/p/solana-consumer-apps) given below.

### Wallets

The most popular Solana wallets are [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) (~800k users on the chrome store at the time of writing) & [Solflare](https://solflare.com/) (~40k users) & [Sollet](https://www.sollet.io/) (open source and more suited for developers).

### DeFi

**DEXs & Swaps**

You can buy and sell tokens at market-determined prices here. Raydium is probably one of the more popular ones.

**Lending and Borrowing**

You can earn interest by depositing into liquidity pools and borrowing against the collateral you've deposited. Some of the popular projects for this are [Marinade](https://marinade.finance/), [Parrot](https://parrot.fi/mint/),[Francium](https://francium.io/) & an upcoming one is [Cropper Finance](https://cropper.finance/pools/).

**Baskets & Indices**

[Solrise](https://solsea.io/) & [Symmetry](https://solanart.io/) are two products that are going to provide baskets - similar to index funds - which simplify thematic or focused investing.

### NFT Marketplaces

These are places where you'll browse, discover and buy NFTs. Solana offers a lot to the degen NFT Collector due to its high-speed transactions and **NO GAS FEES.** You can browse projects out on marketplaces like Solsea and  Solanart.

### Gaming

Two of the most anticipated games right now are Star Atlas & DeFi land:

1.  [Star Atlas](https://staratlas.com/) is a space warfare game currently in development. They've sold a lot of tokens & NFTs and there's a lot of excitement for it.

2.  [DeFi Land](https://defiland.app/en) has just announced a second IDO on Raydium after a successful first one on Solanium. They attempt to gamify the world of finance - you can learn more about them in an earlier super team deep dive [here](https://superteam.substack.com/p/defi-land).

### Social Networks

This is probably the most nascent of all spaces because base blockchains are yet to get the critical mass needed for these network effects to kick in. Couple of shoutouts:

1.  Audius: Like spotify on-chain, audius migrated to Solana because of low cost and high speed.

2.  Grape: While the long term mission is to build a toolset for DAOs, the grape discord is currently the best gateway into Solana. You can learn about upcoming projects, NFTs, games and meet teams through AMAs etc there (Disclaimer: I hold some grape and recently got involved with their DAO).

3.  Gari: A web2 tik tok competitor in India has decided to issue their own creator coin (GARI) on Solana enabling direct monetization and community ownership.
